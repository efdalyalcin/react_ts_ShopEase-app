# ShopEase - E-commerce Page

Welcome to ShopEase, an e-commerce platform currently in development! This project aims to create a seamless online shopping experience with a focus on a user-friendly interface and robust functionality.

## Preview

To get a sneak peek at the design and layout, check out the [Figma file](<https://www.figma.com/file/DhQFsH3NRqtUQni76CiLTB/Figma-ecommerce-UI-Kit-(web-%26-mobile)-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1>). This Figma file serves as the foundation for the visual elements of the ShopEase application.

## Features

- **Product Display:** Easily navigate through a variety of products, displayed in a visually appealing manner. Scroll through using mouse drag for desktop or touch gestures for mobile and tablet devices.
- **Responsive Design:** ShopEase is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices. The layout adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable shopping experience.
- **Product Categories:** Explore products conveniently categorized for efficient browsing.
- **Search Functionality:** Utilize the search feature to find specific products quickly.
- **Shopping Cart:** Add products to your cart and seamlessly manage your shopping list.

## API Integration

Currently, ShopEase uses [fakeapi.com](https://fakeapi.com) as its API. However, a transition is in progress to implement a custom backend using NestJS and PostgreSQL. This move is aimed at enhancing data management and ensuring a more robust platform.

## Development Status

- **Completed:**

  - Product search functionality.
  - Adding products to the shopping cart.

- **In Development:**
  - User profiles.
  - Order history.

Please note that the development of user profiles and order history features is underway. Due to limitations in the dummy API, these features are being carefully crafted to meet specific requirements.
